This is a script for the AutoHotKey program from http://www.autohotkey.com/

AnyDVD and AnyDVD Ripper (the part that this script uses) come from SlySoft http://www.slysoft.com/en/anydvd.html

There have been threads on their forums asking for 2 things:
1) when a DVD is inserted, automatically start the backup
2) when the backup is done, automatically eject
(implicit) 3) when a new disc is inserted, have it start the backup again

This way those of us with many DVD's to back up (We've lost too many to the kids causing scratches on them) can 
make it a little easier and a lot faster, since without something like this you have to remember to go check 
what the backup status is, swap the discs, then start the new backup.
